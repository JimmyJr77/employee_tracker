The app addresses the challenge of managing personnel effectively by offering a centralized platform for recording changes and identifying data surrounding each employee.

#### What Was Learned:
Through the development of this app, valuable insights were gained into user-centric design principles and the importance of creating a seamless user experience. Additionally, I gained technical proficiency with SQL, database management, node, inquirer, exporting modules, and using dotenv.
